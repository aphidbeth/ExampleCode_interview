Explaination of files in the R folder

I have included a script from each of my thesis chapters as an example of some of the coding I have done in R. 

HT_model_stats.R is a script from my second chapter analysing the difference in heat tolerance between different clonal lineages of aphids.

CH3_NetworkAttributes.R is a script from my third chapter in which I used a minimum spanning network to assess the relationships between individuals aphids
based on genetic distance and further extracted some information about specific nodes in the graph using i-graph and ggraph packages. 

CH3_functs_tidy.R is just a script where I wrote/kept functions to prevent them cluttering up the main analysis scripts.

Aphrad19_PlotMLTree_tidy.R is a script from my fourth chapter where I used sequencing data to assess relationships between aphid populations across
the UK. This script creates ML tree plots from files created using RAxML.
